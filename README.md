# DeepNeutrino
Software for Deep Learning and neutrino experiment
## Dependences

* uproot may be useful. It is the fastest software that I have found regarding turning ROOT TTrees into numpy arrays. It is not the official ROOT software supported by CERN. To install it type `$ pip3 install uproot` .
* ROOT CERN and PyROOT are useful, However uproot is faster. 
* numpy, obviously.
* Tensor Flow, for deep learning purposes.
* Keras, to implement deep learning model relatively fast.
